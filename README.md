The game is very simple, after the game starts:

- A color will flash, lets say blue
- You have to click the blue box
- Another color will flash, let's say red
- You have to click first the blue, than the red
- Another color will flash, let's say red again
- You have to click blue, red, red
- ...

If you make a mistake, you lose and have the option to start again.
